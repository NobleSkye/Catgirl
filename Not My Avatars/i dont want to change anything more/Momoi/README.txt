This is the avatars for Figura, the skin mod for Minecraft Java Edition, which are imitated characters who appear in "Blue Archive" the game for mobile devices.

Target figura version: 0.1.4

(Some avatar functions don't work correctly in Minecraft 1.20.4 doe to a bug in Figura. I recommend using in Minecraft 1.20.1.)


# How to use
Figura is available in Forge, Fabric and NeoForge.

1. Install the mod loader which you want to use and make the mods available.
2. Install Figura. Note the mod dependencies.
3. Go to the release page.
   - You can also go there from the right side of the repository's home page.
4. Download the avatar of your choice that attached to "Assets" section of the release notes.
5. Unzip the zipped file and take the avatar data inside this.
6. Put avatar files at "<minecraft_instance_directory>/figura/avatars/".
   - The directory will automatically generated after launching the game with Figura installed. You can also create it manually if it doesn't exist.
7. Open the Figura menu (Δ mark) from the game menu.
8. Select the avatar from the avatar list at the left of the Figura menu.
9. Sets your permission if you need.
10. Other Figura players can see your avatar after uploading your avatar to the Figura server.
    - If your Minecraft is Pirated (cracked, unlicensed, free), you cannot upload your avatar. This is a Figura specification and I cannot help you with this.


# Notes
- I'm not responsible for any damages caused by using this avatar.
- This avatar is designed for work with no resource pack and no other mods are installed. An unexpected issue may occurs when you use it with any resource packs and mods (texture and armor inconsistencies, etc.). However, I may not support you in these cases.
- There may be a bug which occurs in multiplayer because my (Gakuto1112) multiplayer environment to verify the avatar is insufficient.
- Please report an issue if you find it.
- Please contact me via Discussions or Discord if you want to do for my avatars. My Discord name is "vinny_san" and display name is "ばにーさん". My display name in Figura Discord server is "BunnySan/ばにーさん".
